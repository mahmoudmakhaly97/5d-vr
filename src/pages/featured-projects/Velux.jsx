      <p> <strong>Velux</strong> , a global leader in skylights and roof windows, sought to simplify the installation process for their customers. To achieve this, we collaborated with <strong>Khora (Denmark)</strong> to develop an <strong> Augmented Reality (AR) application</strong> that provides an <strong>interactive, step-by-step installation</strong> guide for Velux products.

      </p>
      <h5 className="my-3 d-block"><strong>Seamless Installation with AR
      </strong> </h5>
      <p>The application allows users to visualize and follow <strong>precise installation steps</strong> in real-time, ensuring an intuitive and <strong>error-free setup</strong>. Through <strong>immersive 3D instructions</strong>, users can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li  className="my-2">
        ðŸ”¹ <strong>See each step unfold in AR </strong> directly on their window space
   </li>
   <li>
   ðŸ”¹ <strong>Follow an interactive, hands-on guide</strong> with easy-to-understand visuals
   </li>
   <li className="mt-2">
   ðŸ”¹ <strong>Enhance accuracy & efficiency,</strong> reducing installation time and mistakes
   </li>
      </ul>
      <h6 className="my-3"><strong>A Dual Approach â€“ AR & 3D Marketing Video
      </strong> </h6>
 <p>Beyond practical installation assistance, we developed a <strong>high-quality 3D animated version for marketing purposes,</strong> helping Velux showcase their products in an engaging and visually appealing way.
 </p>
 <h6 className="my-3"><strong>Why It Stands Out? </strong></h6>
<ul>
    <li>
    âœ…<strong>  User-friendly & Informative â€“ </strong>No technical expertise required
    </li>
    <li className="my-2">
    âœ… <strong>Immersive & Interactive â€“</strong> AR makes installation intuitive and engaging
    </li>
    <li>âœ…   <strong>Versatile Usage â€“</strong>  AR for customers, 3D video for promotional content
   </li>
</ul>
<p className="my-3">
This <strong>innovative AR solution bridges the gap between product and user,</strong> transforming how customers interact with Velux products while reinforcing the brandâ€™s commitment to <strong>smart, customer-centric solutions.</strong>
